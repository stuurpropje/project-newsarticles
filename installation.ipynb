    "A notebook consists of a sequence of cells. A cell is a multi-line text input field, and its contents can be executed by typing `Shift-Enter`, or by clicking the `Run` button in the toolbar. What exactly this does depends on the type of cell. There are four types of cells: *code cells*, *markdown cells*, *raw cells* and *heading cells*. We will only focus on the first 2; code and markdown. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a dropdown on the toolbar (which will be `Code`, initially).\n",

    "In a code cell you can write *Python* code. When you run that cell (click on it and press `Shift-Enter`) the code in the cell will run, and the output of the cell will be displayed beneath the cell. Lets try out a very simple code cell below"
